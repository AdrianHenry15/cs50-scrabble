# HarvardX CS50's Introduction To Computer Science

## Week 2 Lab: Scrabble

```
$ ./scrabble
Player 1: COMPUTER
Player 2: science
Player 1 wins!
```

### Background
In the game of Scrabble, players create words to score points, and the number of points is the sum of the point values of each letter in the word.
| A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T | U | V | W | X | Y | Z |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | 2 | 4 | 1 | 8 | 5 | 1 | 3 | 1 | 1 | 3 | 10 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 4 | 4 | 8 | 4 | 10 |

For example, if we wanted to score the word `Code`, we would note that in general Scrabble rules, the `C` is worth `3` points, the `o` is worth `1` point, the `d` is worth `2` points, and the `e` is worth `1` point. Summing these, we get that `Code` is worth `3 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7` points.
